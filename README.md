# TranslateAI

TranslateAI is a powerful real-time speech translation desktop application built using PyQt and Hugging Face models. It enables users to seamlessly convert spoken words into text and translate them into different languages.

This app allows you to:

- Select your preferred input device, whether it's a microphone or system audio, ensuring flexibility in capturing speech.
- Speak or even play pre-recorded audio files, and the app will process and transcribe the speech into text in real time.
- Enjoy an automatic translation trigger, which activates after about 1 second of silence, making the experience smooth and natural.
- Translate between multiple languages, including Turkish üáπüá∑, English üá¨üáß, Spanish üá™üá∏, and French üá´üá∑, with the possibility of adding more in the future.


Designed with ease of use and efficiency in mind, TranslateAI brings a fluid translation experience for various use cases, whether you're learning a new language, working in multilingual environments, or simply looking for an intuitive speech-to-text tool.

## üì¶ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/furkankarakuz/TranslateAI.git
cd TranslateAI
```

### 2. Set Up a Python Environment (Recommended)

It‚Äôs often best to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note**: If `requirements.txt` doesn‚Äôt exist or you prefer manual installation, make sure to install:
> - `PyQt5` or `PyQt6` (depending on your code)
> - `pyaudio` (or `sounddevice` / `pydub` if you adapt the code)
> - `torch`, `transformers`, `datasets` (for Hugging Face)

### MacOS

On **macOS**, you may need to install `portaudio` via Homebrew before installing `pyaudio`:

```bash
brew install portaudio
```

Then:

```bash
pip install pyaudio
```

### Windows

On **Windows**, you can directly install `pyaudio` from PyPI:

```bash
pip install pyaudio
```

If you encounter issues, you might need to install the appropriate **Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools**.

### Linux

On **Linux** (Ubuntu/Debian-based), you may need:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio
```

Then install Python packages as usual:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Select Your Audio Device**  
   - In the top section of the UI, choose your microphone or system audio input (e.g., ‚ÄúMacBook Air Microphone ‚Ä¶‚Äù).

3. **Choose Language Pair**  
   - Select the **source** and **target** language. For example, `EN-TR` means you will speak English and get Turkish translations.

4. **Start Recording**  
   - Click **Start Record** to begin capturing audio.  
   - Watch the volume indicator to see if audio is being detected.  
   - After you **stop speaking for about 1 second**, the application will automatically **trigger the translation**.

5. **View Translations**  
   - The translated text will appear in the console.  

6. **Stop Recording**  
   - Click **Stop Record** when finished.

## üß† How It Works

### Speech Detection

- **PyAudio** captures your microphone input (or chosen device).  
- A **volume level meter** is displayed to help you monitor input levels.  
- Once **silence** (below a certain threshold) is detected for ~1 second, the app processes the captured audio chunk and sends it for transcription & translation.

### Translation Model

- The application uses **Hugging Face** Transformers to download and run the appropriate translation model for the chosen language pair.  
- **Model caching**: Once a model is downloaded, it should be reused for subsequent translations to save time.  
- The translations are displayed in real-time, providing an **instant** feedback loop.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

- **Silence Threshold & Delay**: Currently set to about 1 second. You can modify this value in the code if you want quicker or slower triggers.  
- **Language Support**: To add a new language pair, you need to:
  - Find a Hugging Face translation model that supports that pair.
  - Update the UI to include the new language option.
  - Adjust the code that downloads/loads the model.
